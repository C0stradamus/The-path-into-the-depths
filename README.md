Nothing wild, nothing big.

This is a Powershell script that runs without error messages from version 3 and above. 

It permanently changes your MachineGuid and SystemProductName.

It was explicitly not designed to go into depth so as not to damage any PCs. Accordingly, I have not included a MAC change here, as there are too many variables for this, so I am only working with stable PowershellCMDlets here.

Paste the script into Powershell and off you go.
Admin rights will be obtained automatically, depending on how your execution policy is set.
